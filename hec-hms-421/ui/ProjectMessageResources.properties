#
#  All project messages have code numbers beginning at 10000 and ending at 19000.
#
#  Each class has its own block of message numbers.  Even if the same message
#  is issued from multiple classes, it should have a unique number in each class
#  to aid in debugging.
#
#  There are extra numbers alloted for classes which already have error messages.
#  If you need to add an error message, search for the class name and use next
#  available message number for that class.  If the class needing the new message
#  is not currently listed in this resource bundle, add the class at the bottom
#  of the bundle, eventhough the class name will not be in alphbetical order.
