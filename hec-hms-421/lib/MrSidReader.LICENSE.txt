LIZARDTECH hereby grants to LICENSEE a non-exclusive license to install DSDK on a reasonable number of CPUs in LICENSEE's own facilities only for its own internal use and development of Licensed Products that view *.sid files. LICENSEE may not permit development use of DSDK by a subcontractor unless the subcontractor agrees to a written agreement that will maintain both LIZARDTECH's intellectual property rights in the DSDK and confidentiality about attributes of the DSDK during the development process. Neither LICENSEE nor its subcontractors (if applicable) may modify, reverse engineer, disassemble or decompile or otherwise seek to discover the source code or trade secrets of DSDK.

2.2	No Encoding.  LICENSEE may not use DSDK to develop products or allow others to develop products that encode files into the MrSID format.
